# The base image is minimal and already includes:
# - /data directory with proper permissions
# - Correct entrypoint and command
# - All necessary binaries

# Expose ports (documentation only, actual ports defined in docker-compose)
EXPOSE 9000 8000

# Use the base image's default entrypoint and command
# No need to override anything
